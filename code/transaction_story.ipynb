    "## Abstract\n",
    "We would like to analyse the Dunnhumby dataset. Living in a time and age where every piece of our data is stored and analysed; and being active consumers ourselves, we would like to see what informations retail chains can gather and infer about us knowing only our shopping habits. As transactions over two years of several households and their basic demographic profiles are provided, we want to see if there are any links and correlations between specific demographics (e.g. marital status, income, number of children, etc) and purchase patterns. Furthermore, if time permits it, we want to see if we can create a model predicting a consumer demographic profile from their shopping. Thus, we would like to see how \"easy\" and how precise it actually is for retailers to infer who their customer is by what they buy and target them with specific marketing. Basically, we want to know how much of a target we actually\n",

    "- Can we relate shopping trends to specific demographic parameters ?\n",
    "- Can we predict some of these demographic parameters (age, marital statute etc) with knowing the household's habbits?\n",
    "- In the opposite way, can we predict household consumption behaviour with knowing its characteristics?\n",
    "- What accuracy in consumption prediction can the retailer obtain from a simple profile information?"
