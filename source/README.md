This folder contains all notebooks. You normally only need to run the main notebook. For this you need the data available from this [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/105Wt4yOG6wWB9nhq2QOGGY8JKT2J1ENV?usp=sharing). The data from the drive should be put in the **saved_structures** folder.
