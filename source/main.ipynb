    "## Abstract\n",
    "We would like to analyse the Dunnhumby dataset. Living in a time and age where every piece of our data is stored and analysed; and being active consumers ourselves, we would like to see what informations retail chains can gather and infer about us knowing only our shopping habits. As transactions over two years of several households and their basic demographic profiles are provided, we want to see if there are any links and correlations between specific demographics (e.g. marital status, income, number of children, etc) and purchase patterns. Furthermore, if time permits it, we want to see if we can create a model predicting a consumer demographic profile from their shopping. Thus, we would like to see how \"easy\" and how precise it actually is for retailers to infer who their customer is by what they buy and target them with specific marketing. Basically, we want to know how much of a target we actually\n",

Nevertheless this would not work if we only have partial information about what they buy in total per week (e.g. if they also buy it from somewhere else).We would only have information about habits at this local retailer.

The \"higher\" correlations (around *0.7*) are for the weekly quantities of produce, processed foods and household quantities.

Nevertheless as the coefficient is lower than 0.8, we cannot really say that it is significant. \n",
